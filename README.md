# Intro

Simple project that walks you through the basics of how Domain Driven Design can be leveraged with a functional programming language. This is very much a work in progress and is based off of the work of Scott Walician in F#. Truly love the work that he has done and strongly encourage you to look him up on twitter, youtube or checkpout his site https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/

Each directory tries to introduce the a single area. 

I hope that you find this helpful and if anything you see is off or can be improved on please feel free to let me know.
